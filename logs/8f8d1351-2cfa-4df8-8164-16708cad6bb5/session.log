I see from the summary that a heartbeat endpoint already exists at              
pages/api/heartbeat.js that returns { status: 'ok' } without DB access, which   
fulfills the requirement. Therefore, no code changes are needed.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
Based on the instructions, the heartbeat endpoint already exists at             
pages/api/heartbeat.js and returns a lightweight JSON response without DB       
access. The tasks described in config/HEARTBEAT.md appear to be complete, so no 
code changes are needed.
