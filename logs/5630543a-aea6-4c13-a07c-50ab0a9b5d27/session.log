To implement this audit report, the most likely file that needs to be changed   
is:                                                                             

 • .github/workflows/audit-auto-merge.yml (or a similar workflow file that you  
   will create or modify to run the audit script)                               

Please add that file to the chat so I can provide the complete updated file     
content. If it does not exist yet, let me know and I’ll create it.
