I have read the config/HEARTBEAT.md file and reviewed the tasks.                

Based on the read-only summary of pages/api/heartbeat.js that was previously    
provided, the file already exists and implements the requested heartbeat        
endpoint, returning HTTP 200 with { "status": "ok" } and without importing any  
modules that would trigger DB initialization. Therefore, tasks 1 and 2 are      
already completed.                                                              

Regarding task 3, to "Add a comment in the new route file explaining that it    
must remain lightweight and DB-free for monitoring purposes," I cannot propose  
this change directly because pages/api/heartbeat.js was provided as a read-only 
file. If you would like me to add this comment, please add                      
pages/api/heartbeat.js to the chat so I can edit it.                            

Task 4 is optional, and no documentation files were added to the chat for me to 
update.                                                                         

Therefore, no code changes are necessary for the files currently added to the   
chat to complete the core requirements of config/HEARTBEAT.md.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
Upon reviewing config/HEARTBEAT.md and the provided pages/api/heartbeat.js file,
I find that all described tasks are already met by the current content of       
pages/api/heartbeat.js:                                                         

 1 The endpoint pages/api/heartbeat.js exists and returns HTTP 200 with {       
   "status": "ok" }.                                                            
 2 The route does not import or call any code that triggers DB initialization.  
 3 The file includes an important comment explaining that it should remain      
   lightweight and DB-free for monitoring purposes.                             
 4 No documentation files were provided for the optional update.                

Therefore, no changes are needed for the files currently in the chat to complete
the tasks from config/HEARTBEAT.md.
