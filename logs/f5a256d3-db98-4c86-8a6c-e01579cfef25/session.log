I'll help you create the local-calendar skill. Based on the requirements, I need
to create new files rather than modify existing ones. Here are the files I'll   
create:                                                                         

 1 pi-skills/local-calendar/SKILL.md - Documentation and front-matter           
 2 pi-skills/local-calendar/add-apt.sh - Script to add appointments             
 3 pi-skills/local-calendar/list-today.sh - Script to list today's events       
 4 pi-skills/local-calendar/list-week.sh - Script to list next 7 days           
 5 pi-skills/local-calendar/del-event.sh - Script to delete events by UID       
 6 pi-skills/local-calendar/sync-from-ha.sh - Script to sync from Home Assistant
   (optional)                                                                   

These will all be new files since this is a new skill being created. Would you  
like me to add these files to the chat so I can create them?
