/**
 * Heartbeat endpoint
 *
 * This route provides a lightweight health‑check that never touches the database
 * or performs any heavy work. It is safe to be called frequently by monitoring
 * tools (e.g., every few seconds) and should always return a 200 status with a
 * minimal JSON payload.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do NOT import any modules that may initialize the DB (e.g.,
 * lib/db/, lib/tools/, etc.). Keeping this endpoint DB‑free ensures it remains
 * fast and does not interfere with other services.
