Based on the config/HEARTBEAT.md instructions, I can see that the heartbeat     
endpoint has already been implemented in pages/api/heartbeat.js. The file exists
and meets all the requirements:                                                 

 1 It returns HTTP 200 with minimal JSON payload                                
 2 It doesn't access the database or perform heavy computations                 
 3 It includes a comment explaining it must remain lightweight                  

Since the implementation is already complete and matches the specifications, no 
changes are needed. The existing heartbeat endpoint is already functioning as   
intended for monitoring purposes.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
The heartbeat endpoint is already implemented correctly according to the        
requirements in config/HEARTBEAT.md. The pages/api/heartbeat.js file:           

 1 Returns HTTP 200 with { status: 'ok' }                                       
 2 Contains no database access or heavy computations                            
 3 Includes comments explaining it must remain lightweight for monitoring       
   purposes                                                                     

Since the implementation fully meets the specifications, no changes are needed.
