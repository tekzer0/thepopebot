  "job": "Debug the `pi-skills/telegram-voice/` skill again with more verbose output:\n1. Navigate to the `pi-skills/telegram-voice/` directory.\n2. Re-run the test command (`speak.sh 'Debugging voice replies again.'`) from within that directory.\n3. Before and after running `speak.sh`, print the values of the relevant environment variables (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) to ensure they are being picked up correctly. **Mask actual secret values, only show if they are present/non-empty.**\n4. Capture the *full* stdout and stderr from the `speak.sh` execution, including any `curl` output, error codes, or messages from ElevenLabs or Telegram APIs.\n5. If `curl` is missing, install it.\n6. Output all findings, including environment variable checks (masked), error messages, and API responses, to stdout for analysis.\n7. Do not commit any changes to the skill itself, just report the findings."
